# rule-engine

A simple POC of a rule engine with some restrictions:

* Rules have conditions and actions
* Actions only should be performed when all conditions are true
* Conditions can have parameter and value
* Rules should be performed in order that are added
* Conditions should be performed in order that are added
* Actions should be performed in order that are added
* Actions can return:
    * OK
    * Error
    * Stop process actions
    * Stop process rules
